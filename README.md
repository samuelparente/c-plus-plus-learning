# C++ Exercises and Examples

This repository contains a collection of C++ programs covering various topics in the language. Each program is designed to demonstrate my understanding of different concepts and features in C++.

## Topics Covered

### 1. C++ Basics
   - Introduction to C++ programming language.
   - Variables and data types.
   - Operators for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.
   - Input/output operations using standard streams.

### 2. Control Structures
   - Conditional statements such as if, else-if, and switch-case.
   - Looping constructs including while, do-while, and for loops.
   - Using break and continue statements for control flow.

### 3. Functions
   - Defining and calling functions with and without parameters.
   - Function overloading to create multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists.
   - Recursion, where a function calls itself.

### 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   - Introduction to classes and objects.
   - Class methods for encapsulating behavior.
   - Constructors and destructors for initializing and cleaning up objects.
   - Inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes.
   - Polymorphism, including function overriding and virtual functions.

### 5. Data Structures
   - Arrays to store collections of elements of the same type.
   - Structures to define custom data types with multiple fields.
   - Pointers and references for working with memory addresses and dynamic memory allocation.

### 6. File Handling
   - Reading from and writing to files using input/output file streams.
   - Handling file operations such as opening, closing, reading, and writing data.

### 7. Exception Handling
   - Using try, catch, and throw blocks to handle runtime errors and exceptions gracefully.
   - Exception specifications for specifying the types of exceptions that can be thrown by a function.

## How to Use

Each program is contained in its own file and is accompanied by comments explaining the purpose and functionality of the code. You can simply clone this repository and explore the programs to gain insights into different aspects of C++ programming.

To run the programs, you'll need a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can compile and execute the programs using your preferred development environment or command-line tools.
